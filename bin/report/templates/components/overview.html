      This report contains tables and plots to help interpret the outcome of RNASeq run and the viral detection analyses performed.<br>
      <strong>Section I</strong> provides a summary of the input parameters, quality control metrics and an overview of the detected viruses from the different analyses performed (if at least one de novo contig was assigned to a virus).<br>
      <strong>Section II and III</strong> provides the detailed results for the direct read search performed using Kraken2 and Kaiju respectively.<br>
      <strong>Section IV</strong> shows the candidate virus detected using de novo assembly followed by megablast homology search.<br>
      <strong>Section V</strong> shows consensus generated when mapping back to viral reference genomes detected by megablast in Section IV.<br>
      <strong>Section VI</strong> shows potential novel viral sequences derived by de novo assembly that did not match any known viral reference sequence but have viral characteristics (based on geNomad and hmmscan).
