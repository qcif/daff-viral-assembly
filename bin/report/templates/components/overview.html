      This report contains tables and plots to help interpret the outcome of the sequencing run and the viral detection analyses performed.
      Section I summarises the input data and quality control metrics.
      Section II provides an overview of the virus detected by 1) megablast homology search using de novo assembled contigs and/or 2) direct read search (using Kraken2 and Kaiju).
      Section III-V show the detailed results for each of these analyses separately (Kraken, Kaiju2 and megablast).
      Section VI shows consensus generated when mapping back to viral reference genomes detected by megablast in Section V.
      Section VII shows potential novel viral sequences detected by de novo assembly that did not match any known viral reference sequence but have viral characteristics (based on geNomad and hmmscan).
