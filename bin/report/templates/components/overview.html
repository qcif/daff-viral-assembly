      This report contains tables and plots to help interpret the outcome of the sequencing run and the viral detection analyses performed.  
      Section I provides a summary of the input data, the quality control metrics and an overview of the detected viruses from the different analyses performed (if at least one de novo contig was assigned to a virus).  
      Section II and III provides the detailed results for the direct read search performed using Kraken2 and Kaiju res[ectively.  
      Section IV show the candidate virus detected using de novo assembly followed by megablast homology search.  
      Section V shows consensus generated when mapping back to viral reference genomes detected by megablast in Section IV.
      Section VI shows potential novel viral sequences detected by de novo assembly that did not match any known viral reference sequence but have viral characteristics (based on geNomad and hmmscan).
