<h2>Consensus sequences</h2>

<p>
  This section shows the consensus sequences assembled from the sequencing reads. Based on the data shown here, the analyst should select one of more consensus sequences as a reference for taxonomic identification of the sample.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
  It is likely that not all sequences shown here match the sample organism. Erroneous sequences often result from sample contamination or from sequencing/assembly artefacts. It is the responsibility of the analyst to select the most appropriate sequence(s) for taxonomic identification based on the evidence shown. Furthermore, the results shown here <strong>cannot be used</strong> to make a confident assessment of the sample taxonomy. Taxonomic identity should be determined by downstream analysis.
